Problem 1:
 Zingaro stone printing is a company that specializes in printing images or patterns on polished or unpolished stones. However, for the optimum level of printing of the image the stone surface has to have a Brinell's hardness index of at least 150. Recently, Zingaro has received a batch of polished and unpolished stones from its clients. Use the data provided to answer the following (assuming a 5% significance level);

 1.1 Earlier experience of Zingaro with this particular client is favorable as the stone surface was found to be of adequate hardness. However, Zingaro has reason to believe now that the unpolished stones may not be suitable for printing. Do you think Zingaro is justified in thinking so?

1.2 Is the mean hardness of the polished and unpolished stones the same?



Problem 2: 
Aquarius health club, one of the largest and most popular cross-fit gyms in the country has been advertising a rigorous program for body conditioning. The program is considered successful if the candidate is able to do more than 5 push-ups, as compared to when he/she enrolled in the program. Using the sample data provided can you conclude whether the program is successful? (Consider the level of Significance as 5%)

Note that this is a problem of the paired-t-test. Since the claim is that the training will make a difference of more than 5, the null and alternative hypotheses must be formed accordingly. 



Problem 3: 

Dental implant data: The hardness of metal implant in dental cavities depends on multiple factors, such as the method of implant, the temperature at which the metal is treated, the alloy used as well as on the dentists who may favour one method above another and may work better in his/her favourite method. The response is the variable of interest.

Is there any difference among the dentists on the implant hardness?
Is there any difference among the methods on the implant hardness?
Is there any difference among the temperature levels on the implant hardness?
